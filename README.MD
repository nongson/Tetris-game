# Tetris

## **_A Tetris game made with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript._**

**Getting Started**

* To get started with the project, simply download or clone the repository and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

**How to Play**

* The objective of the game is to clear lines of blocks by placing them in a way that forms a complete row. The player can move the blocks left, right, down, and rotate them using the arrow keys. When a block lands on the bottom of the screen, it will disappear and new blocks will fall into place.
